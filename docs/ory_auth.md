# Modern API Authentication Strategy

## OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC)

The most modern and secure approach for API authentication is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). This approach provides several benefits:

1. **Standardization**: Widely adopted and supported across the industry.
2. **Security**: Provides robust security measures and is constantly reviewed by the security community.
3. **Flexibility**: Supports various grant types for different use cases (e.g., client credentials, authorization code).
4. **Scalability**: Designed to work well in distributed systems.
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates authentication from authorization.

## Implementation with Ory

Using Ory's suite of tools, we can implement this strategy as follows:

1. **Ory Hydra**: Acts as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.
2. **Ory Oathkeeper**: Handles API gateway functions and token validation.
3. **Ory Kratos**: Manages user identities and authentication (useful for the admin portal).

## Client Application Flow

For a long-running, unattended application:

1. Use the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant type.
2. The client securely stores its client ID and client secret.
3. The client exchanges these for an access token.
4. The access token is used to authenticate API requests.
5. When the token expires, the client automatically requests a new one.

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Expiration**: Set reasonably short expiration times (e.g., 1 hour) to limit the impact of token leaks.
2. **Token Renewal**: Implement automatic token renewal in client libraries.
3. **Scopes**: Use scopes to limit the permissions of each client.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual patterns.
5. **Revocation**: Provide the ability to revoke client credentials if compromised.

## Developer Experience

To maintain a good developer experience:

1. Provide clear documentation on obtaining and using client credentials.
2. Offer client libraries that handle token management automatically.
3. Implement a user-friendly admin portal for managing OAuth clients.
4. Consider offering a "playground" or interactive API documentation (e.g., with Swagger UI) that supports OAuth 2.0.

## Migration Strategy

For existing users of API keys:

1. Implement the OAuth 2.0 system alongside the existing API key system.
2. Provide a migration path for users to transition from API keys to OAuth clients.
3. Set a deprecation timeline for the API key system.
